## 🎯 Layer Descriptions

### 1. `domain/` - Core Business Logic (Innermost Layer)

**Purpose:** Contains the core business logic and rules that are completely independent of frameworks, databases, and external systems.

**Structure:**
- **`domain/transaction/`**: Holds the transaction aggregate: entity, value objects, and domain exceptions in one place.
- **`exception/`**: Domain-specific exceptions that represent business rule violations (`InvalidTransactionException`, `TransactionNotFoundException`).

**Key Principles:**
- No dependencies on external frameworks
- Pure Java business logic
- Framework-agnostic code
- Contains the most stable and reusable code

**Example contents (implemented):**
- `Transaction` entity (with `create`, `restore`, `process`)
- Value objects: `TransactionID`, `Money`, `Currency`, `TransactionStatus`, `TransactionType`
- Domain exceptions: `InvalidTransactionException`, `TransactionNotFoundException`

---

### 2. `application/` - Use Cases and Application Logic

**Purpose:** Orchestrates use cases and defines the application's behavior. Acts as a bridge between the domain and infrastructure layers. Defines ports (interfaces) that infrastructure implements.

**Structure:**
- **`events/`**: Application events used for messaging (`TransactionCreatedEvent`, `TransactionProcessedEvent`).
- **`publisher/`**: Output ports for publishing events (`TransactionEventPublisher`, `TransactionProcessedEventPublisher`).
- **`repository/`**: Output port for persistence (`TransactionRepository`).
- **`usecases/`**: Use case implementations and their commands (e.g., `CreateTransactionUseCase`, `CreateTransactionCommand`, `GetTransactionByIdUseCase`, `ProcessTransactionUseCase`).

**Key Principles:**
- Depends only on `domain/`
- Contains orchestration logic, not business rules
- Business rules stay in `domain/`
- Ports are interfaces; infrastructure provides implementations

**Example contents (implemented):**
- Use cases: `CreateTransactionUseCase`, `GetTransactionByIdUseCase`, `ProcessTransactionUseCase`
- Commands: `CreateTransactionCommand`
- Ports: `TransactionRepository`, `TransactionEventPublisher`, `TransactionProcessedEventPublisher`
- Events: `TransactionCreatedEvent`, `TransactionProcessedEvent`

---

### 3. `infrastructure/` - External Concerns (Outer Layer)

**Purpose:** Implements all external dependencies and framework-specific code. This is where you interact with databases, message brokers, HTTP interfaces, etc.

**Structure:**
- **`config/`**: Spring and infrastructure configuration (use cases, HTTP, JPA, Kafka topics and consumer config).
- **`http/`**: HTTP/REST adapters
  - **`resource/`**: REST entrypoints (`TransactionResource`)
  - **`controller/`**: Controllers that map request/response and delegate to use cases
  - **`request/`**, **`response/`**: Request and response DTOs
  - **`exception/`**: Global exception handling (`AppExceptionHandler`); `ErrorResponse` (used by it) lives in `resource/`
- **`persistence/jpa/`**: Database implementation
  - **`TransactionEntity`**: JPA entity
  - **`JpaTransactionRepository`**: Implements `TransactionRepository`
  - **`TransactionEntityMapper`**: Maps between entity and domain
- **`messaging/`**: Kafka producers and consumers
  - **`publisher/`**: `KafkaTransactionEventPublisher`, `KafkaTransactionProcessedPublisher`, `LogTransactionEventPublisher` (profile-based)
  - **`consumer/`**: `TransactionCreatedEventConsumer` (consumes events, runs `ProcessTransactionUseCase`, publishes processed event)

**Why Resource + Controller**
- REST mapping and status codes in Resource.
- Use case invocation and DTO mapping in Controller for clearer separation and testability.

**Key Principles:**
- HTTP, persistence, and messaging are all implemented.
- REST resources and controllers are thin and delegate to use cases.
- Infrastructure implements the ports defined in `application/` (repository, publishers).
- Infrastructure can depend on frameworks (Spring, JPA, Kafka).

**Example contents (implemented):**
- HTTP: `TransactionResource`, `CreateTransactionController`, `GetTransactionByIdController`, `AppExceptionHandler` (in `exception/`), `CreateTransactionRequest`, `GetTransactionByIdRequest`, `TransactionResponse`, `TransactionDetailsResponse`, `MoneyResponse`, `ErrorResponse` (in `resource/`)
- Persistence: `JpaTransactionRepository`, `TransactionEntity`, `TransactionEntityMapper`, `TransactionJpaRepository`
- Messaging: `KafkaTransactionEventPublisher`, `KafkaTransactionProcessedPublisher`, `TransactionCreatedEventConsumer`, `KafkaTopics`, `KafkaConsumerConfig`
- Config: `ApplicationUseCaseConfig`, `HttpControllerConfig`, `JpaPersistenceConfig`

## 🔄 Dependency Flow

The dependency rule in Clean Architecture states that **dependencies should point inward**:

```
infrastructure → application → domain
```

**Rules:**
- ✅ `infrastructure/` can depend on `application/` and `domain/`
- ✅ `application/` can depend on `domain/`
- ❌ `domain/` **cannot** depend on anything else
- ❌ `application/` **cannot** depend on `infrastructure/`
- ❌ Different parts of `infrastructure/` (e.g., `http/`, `persistence/`, `messaging/`) **should not** depend on each other

This ensures that:
- Business logic remains independent and testable
- You can swap out frameworks without changing business logic
- The domain layer is the most stable and reusable

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Flow A – Creating a transaction (HTTP)

1. **`infrastructure/http/resource/TransactionResource`**
   - Receives HTTP POST at `/transactions`, delegates to `CreateTransactionController`.

2. **`infrastructure/http/controller/CreateTransactionController`**
   - Maps `CreateTransactionRequest` to `CreateTransactionCommand`, calls `CreateTransactionUseCase.execute`.

3. **`application/usecases/CreateTransactionUseCase`**
   - Optionally finds existing by `externalReference` (idempotency).
   - Builds `Transaction` via `Transaction.create(...)` (domain validates).
   - Saves via `TransactionRepository.save` and publishes via `TransactionEventPublisher.publish`.

4. **Infrastructure**
   - **Persistence:** `JpaTransactionRepository` persists the transaction.
   - **Messaging:** When profile `kafka` is active, `KafkaTransactionEventPublisher` publishes `TransactionCreatedEvent` to Kafka.

5. **Back to HTTP**
   - Controller maps `Transaction` to `TransactionResponse`; resource returns 201 with the response body.

### Flow B – Processing a transaction (async, Kafka)

1. **`infrastructure/messaging/consumer/TransactionCreatedEventConsumer`**
   - Consumes `TransactionCreatedEvent` from the Kafka topic (profile `kafka`).

2. **Consumer**
   - Calls `ProcessTransactionUseCase.execute(transactionId)`.

3. **`application/usecases/ProcessTransactionUseCase`**
   - Loads transaction via `TransactionRepository.findById`, calls `transaction.process()` (domain enforces CREATED → PROCESSED), saves the updated transaction.

4. **Consumer**
   - Builds `TransactionProcessedEvent` from the processed transaction and publishes it via `TransactionProcessedEventPublisher` (Kafka implementation).

**Next (planned):** Outbox pattern for atomic persist + publish on creation.

### DLQ Strategy

The Dead Letter Queue is currently used as a safe storage mechanism for
messages that fail after retries.

Automatic reprocessing is intentionally not implemented yet, as it requires
clear business rules and operational visibility.

Future improvement: introduce controlled reprocessing mechanisms.

## 📝 Alternative Naming Conventions

If you prefer different terminology, here are some alternatives:

- **`usecase/`** → `service/` (if you prefer "service" for use cases)
- **`port/`** → `interface/` or `contract/`
- **`infrastructure/http/`** → `adapter/api/` or `presentation/api/` (if you prefer separating adapters from infrastructure)
- **`infrastructure/http/request/`** → `infrastructure/http/dto/` (if you prefer "dto" over "request/response")

The important thing is consistency and clarity within your team. This project uses `infrastructure/http/` to keep all framework-specific code in the infrastructure layer.

## 🎓 Benefits of This Structure

1. **Testability**: Domain and application layers can be tested without frameworks
2. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes code easier to understand
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to swap databases, message brokers, or frameworks
4. **Scalability**: Each layer can evolve independently
5. **Team Collaboration**: Different teams can work on different layers with minimal conflicts
